# HTML Website Structure Project

This project focuses on building the basic structure of a website using **pure HTML**. Think of it as laying down the **bones** of a website. The goal is to create the foundational layout for various sections commonly found in websites, without any styling or interactivity (CSS and JavaScript will come later). Just like how the bones provide the framework for the body, this project provides the structure for a future fully developed website.

## Project Overview

Throughout this project, I created and structured key sections of a website, focusing on semantic HTML to ensure proper layout and accessibility. The main features include:

- **Header Banner**: A prominent header to introduce the site or page content.
- **Quotes Section**: A block for showcasing quotes, including inline and block-level quotes.
- **Videos Section**: A section containing embedded videos for multimedia content.
- **Membership Section**: Displays information related to membership, with images, text, and structured headings.
- **FAQ Section**: Contains a list of questions and answers with organized headings and paragraphs.
- **Footer Section**: Includes links, images, and text content in the footer for additional site information.

## Key Features

- **Headings (Level 1-3)**: Proper use of headings to organize content.
- **Text & Images**: Integration of text and images throughout different sections.
- **Block Elements**: Use of `<div>` and other block-level elements to structure the layout for future styling.

This project serves as the building block for a website, providing the core structure before styling and interactivity are added in later stages of development. Just like bones provide the shape and foundation for the body, this project provides the shape and framework for a functional website.
