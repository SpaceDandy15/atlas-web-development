HTML HEAD TAG project

task 0: has me insert a read me which is this file! 

task 1: had me create an html page with the standard doctype line to declare that this is an html file and then add english as the language. 

task 2: was simply adding the title to the html file.

task 3: wanted a favicon to be added so in addition to that i added extra sizes since this could be viewed on different computers. Like a macbook. 
I also used https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/ to create my favicon. 

task 4: is about meta data, in short meta data is like a hasthag on instagram but for search engines. I believe after some reading that it is best to keep the meta data short. 
Keeping it short allows search engines to look for relevance rather than a bunch of text. Meanwhile not making it vague as well.

task 5: task 5 is about well, me. task 5 makes use of the body and footer portions of the website which is the visible text a user can see.
its very customizable thanks to all the text formatting element.

task 6: wants me to create a second page using a navbar by adding it into index.html with a gallery html. 

Task 7: wants me to make my two pages prettier and more interactive using css.
