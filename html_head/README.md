## Task Breakdown

### Task 0: Add a README File
For Task 0, I was tasked with inserting a README file for the project. This file serves as an introduction to the project and its purpose, outlining what I learned in each subsequent task.

### Task 1: Create HTML Page with Standard Doctype
For Task 1, I created an HTML page that includes the standard `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration to indicate that this is an HTML5 document. Additionally, I declared the document’s language as English using `<html lang="en">`.

### Task 2: Add Title to HTML File
Task 2 was about adding a `<title>` tag within the `<head>` section to define the title that would appear in the browser tab.

### Task 3: Add a Favicon
Task 3 required me to add a favicon to the project. I used [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/) to generate a custom favicon. I included several sizes to ensure compatibility across different devices (like MacBooks and mobile devices).

### Task 4: Add Meta Data
Task 4 focused on meta data, which is important for improving visibility and search engine optimization (SEO). I’ve learned that meta data should be short, relevant, and not overly verbose so that search engines can identify keywords efficiently.

### Task 5: Personalize with Content
Task 5 is about adding personalized content in the body and footer sections of the website. This content represents the visible text that users can read. I made use of various text formatting elements to make the text more readable and engaging.

### Task 6: Create a Second Page with Navbar
In Task 6, I created a second page (`gallery.html`) and added a navigation bar (navbar) within the `index.html` file to allow users to navigate between pages smoothly. This improves the overall site structure and makes it more interactive.

### Task 7: Make Pages Pretty and Interactive Using CSS
Task 7 required me to enhance the visual appeal and interactivity of both pages using CSS. I applied various styles to make the pages look more professional and to enhance user experience through design and layout adjustments.
